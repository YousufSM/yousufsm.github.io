              <strong><i>Industry: Tech, B2B <br>
                  Use Case: Business Process Optimization, Order 2 Cash Cycle Optimization, Process Mining</i></strong>
              <br><br>


              <strong><b>Situation:</b></strong>
              A billion-dollar tech client was facing hurdles in their order to cash
              processes, which were impacting high re-work, causing delivery delays, and leading to disputes.
              The organization operated on SAP system, yet the lack of process transparency was
              bottleneck to the business flow.
              <br><br>
              <strong><b>Task:</b></strong>
              The task was to perform a diagnostic project to scrutinize and optimize the client's business processes,
              understanding how the process flows right from creating a sales order to clearing the invoice. The
              objective was to create a blue print in front of CFO and CEO to show the board how the process happens
              in the org, what are the inefficiencies and what's the impact of that
              <br><br>
              <strong><b>Action:</b></strong>
              Performed process mining using Celonis to delve into the SAP system. Performing ETL to convert SAP data
              into process mining understandable format. Analyzed process flow right from "when a customer place an
              order" to the goods have been issued and
              customer "clear the billing". Analyzed and created dashboards discussing late-deliveries, un-billed
              orders, late-billing orders, manual processes, re-work, late bill payments, order blocks, payment term
              mismatches and disputes and analyzed these KPIs with it's impact on throughput time, automation,
              customer satisfaction and working capital flow.
              <br><br>
              <strong><b>Result:</b></strong>
              The optimization initiative led to a 70% reduction in order rejections, unlocked an additional $110M in
              working capital flow, and reduced overall flow by 7 days. It also brought down payment term mismatches
              by 20% and Days Sales Outstanding by 3 days.

              <br><br>

              <strong><b>Situation:</b></strong>
              The client, a B2B SaaS provider, struggled with their outbound sales motion, securing a dismal rate of 1
              lead per 250 prospects contacted. Client also lacked a unified platform to analyze sales motion and reps
              performance.
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong><b>Task:</b></strong>
              The task was to use Machine Learning to identify prospects with a high chance of conversion. The
              objective was also to create a unified customer database & also to integrate 3rd party data to create a
              customer 360 view and to create dashboard for C-suite to monitor motion's success.
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong><b>Action:</b></strong>
              Developed a propensity model to gauge the likelihood of winning a prospect, ensuring the sales team's
              focus was directed towards high-quality leads. The task was to create an end to end pipeline that would
              collect companies data from internal & multiple 3rd party sources and creating an algorithm that would
              predict the probability to win the customer. The task was also to automate and deploy the pipeline in
              client's environment so for every week the reps should get new leads to target. The pipeline would also
              have an option to re-train the model if in future the client wants to update the algorithm. PRoject also
              included creating a dashboard so the senior management can track the sales motion funnel and effectiveness
              of the sales rep. We also used rule based algorithm to create custom messaging for client's which helps
              sales rep to pitch the Product.
              <br>
              <br>
              <strong><b>Result:</b></strong>
              The newly created outbound acquisition strategy yielded a substantial results by increasing ratio of
              successful leads from 0.4% to 20%.
              The model, based on internal and 3rd party data, would select the prospects that have a high chance of
              conversion. In the 9 weeks pilot, the model helped to lock $0.5M worth of business by targeting just
              1000 prospects

              Pioneering a National Agricultural Database: Connecting Farmers with Agricultural Lands

            </h3>

              <br>

              <strong><i>Industry: Government <br>
                  Use Case: Algorithm Designing, PoC</i></strong>
              <br><br>


              <strong><b>Situation:</b></strong>
              The Central Government envisioned creating a distinctive national-level database that would amalgamate
              agricultural land data with farmer information. This initiative was one of it's kind as no other
              major country had ventured into such a project. The goal was to deliver a Proof of Concept (PoC) to the
              Prime Minister's Office, highlighting the viability and possible success rate of the project<br><br>

              <strong><b>Task:</b></strong>
              The task was to classify provinces (States) based on their existing data infrastructure, technology
              maturity, and database availability. Then for each category, design a PoCs to exhibit the efficacy of
              tagging lands with farmer data.<br><br>

              <strong><b>Action:</b></strong>
              Commenced by scrutinizing the infrastructure, technology maturity, and database readiness in each
              province. Following this, segregated each province into four segments based on the evaluations. A
              distinct PoC was conceptualized for each category, totalling four PoCs. Then, developing a detailed
              algorithm to map land record to farmer's databases based on multiple State and Central Gov databases,
              voter identification cards & phonetic name matching of farmer. The success ratio of tagging
              lands with farmers exhibited variation across the PoCs. In provinces characterized by high tech maturity
              and database accessibility, a success rate of 60% was attained, while in others, it hovered at
              22%.<br><br>

              <strong><b>Result:</b></strong>
              The diverse success rates across different provinces imparted invaluable insights into the hurdles and
              potential remedies for this national-scale initiative. The case, along with the discoveries, was
              presented to the Prime Minister's Office. The case initiated a significant milestone in pioneering
              comprehensive agricultural database with the potential to revolutionize the nation's agricultural
              framework.<br><br>

              The client, an industrial goods manufacturer specializing in lithium batteries, had an unstructured
              pricing strategy that often led to offering higher discounts based on relationships with clients and
              other factors. This lack of standard pricing was perceived as a potential hurdle to realizing higher
              profit margins.<br><br>

              <strong><b>Task:</b></strong>
              The task was to devise a Price Optimization Algorithm that could standardize the pricing strategy,
              taking into account price elasticity to ascertain how much the price could be increased without
              affecting the significant demand. <br><br>

              to provide a structured pricing model. The algorithm was designed to recommend optimal pricing while
              allowing for business-based discounting on top of the model's recommendation. This blended approach
              ensured a balance between standardized pricing and the flexibility to offer discounts based on business
              relationships and other factors.
              <br><br>

              <strong><b>Result:</b></strong>
              The implementation of the price optimization algorithm resulted in a more structured and standardized
              pricing strategy for the client with initial tests suggesting an increase in overall profit margins by
              20%.

            <p>

              <strong><i>Industry: Government<br>
                  Use Case: Optimization</i></strong>
              <br><br>
              <strong><b>Situation:</b></strong>
              Public Transports (PT) in cities faced overcrowding problem, making them unattractive to the masses.
              The
              static timetable followed by transport agencies failed to adjust to varying demand dynamics, leading
              to either low occupancy or
              excessive crowding.<br><br>

              <strong><b>Task:</b></strong>
              The goal was to create an Optimization model to determine the optimal transport frequency,
              that would minimize Operational Cost, Crowding Discomfort, and Waiting Time.<br><br>

              <strong><b>Action:</b></strong>
              Developed a Non-linear Optimization model considering operational costs, waiting time, and crowding
              discomfort. The model was designed to be adaptable to different demand dynamics like holidays,
              weekdays,
              and peak hours, providing insights into ideal bus numbers for various routes.<br><br>

              <strong><b>Result:</b></strong>
              The model provided actionable insights on optimal bus deployment, leading to reduced operational
              costs,
              waiting time, and crowding discomfort. It showcased a potential reduction in road congestion, aligning
              with the city's broader goals of enhancing urban mobility and reducing pollution.<br><br>

              Fast-Track Financing: Harnessing Machine Learning for Speedy and Transparent Credit Evaluations

            </h3>
            <br>
            <p>

              <strong><i>Industry: Banking<br>
                  Use Case: Credit Risk Modelling</i></strong>
              <br><br>
              <strong><b>Situation:</b></strong>
              An India-based Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) had a robust decision-making mechanism for loan
              disbursement, yet it took around 5 days to process a single application. The lengthy decision time was
              seen as a bottleneck in enhancing their service efficiency.<br><br>

              <strong><b>Task:</b></strong>
              The task was to create a machine learning (ML) model to expedite the decision-making process by
              providing a risk-based scoring to applicants, aiming to cut down the decision time and make the
              process
              more transparent.<br><br>

              <strong><b>Action:</b></strong>
              Developed a Credit Risk ML model using R, which leveraged bureau, financial, and application data to
              score applicants. The model bucketed applications based on predicted risk, also providing reason codes
              for the scores to maintain transparency in decision-making. This ensured that decision-makers were
              well-informed on the rationale behind each score.<br><br>

              <strong><b>Result:</b></strong>
              The implementation of the ML model successfully reduced the decision time from 5 days to 3 days,
              cutting
              down 30% of the manual screening workload. The risk-based scoring and the transparency provided by the
              reason codes expedited the loan disbursement process significantly, aligning with the goal of
              enhancing
              service efficiency for the NBFC.<br><br>

              <br><br>
              <strong><b>Situation:</b></strong>
              A leading national bank was witnessing a dip in profitability, with a substantial number of
              branches not meeting performance benchmarks. The bank's decision-making lacked the insights on how to
              identify and measure if a branch in under/over performing and how to create a personalized strategy for
              each branch.
              <br><br>
              <strong><b>Task:</b></strong>
              The task was to design and deploy a predictive ML model to pinpoint profit drivers to understand what
              drives profit. Then, identifying based on linear regression which branches are over/under performing. And
              finally, creating a strategy for each branch based on its performance evaluation, profit margin, growth
              and its location.
              <br><br>
              <strong><b>Action:</b></strong>
              The first step was pooling data. Unified over 15 disparate datasets to create a comprehensive data
              pool, offering a bird's-eye view of branch performance metrics. This was followed by the construction of
              a Machine Learning model to identify the key profit drivers and evaluate branch performance. To
              provide a 360-degree perspective, external market factors like demographics, points of interest, and
              competitive advantages were incorporated, to identity location attractiveness score for each branch.
              Based on
              these insights, a bespoke strategy was recommended for every branch, centered around branch performance,
              location attractiveness, growth, and revenue segment.
              <br><br>
              <strong><b>Result:</b></strong>
              The strategic deployment lead to marked enhancement in branch performance
              evaluation, revealing that over 40% of branches had room for improvement. The real win was the revelation
              that
              these underperformed branches held the potential to amplify their profits by 10%-50%. The bank now had
              a clear set of actionable recommendations for each branch, setting the stage for a significant uptick in
              profitability.

                  Use Case: AI Based Business Strategy, Branch Performance Evaluation, Regression, Profit Driver
                  Analysis </i></strong>
              <br><br>

              <strong><b>Situation:</b></strong>
              A prominent Non-Profit firm, managing assets for 400,000 individuals across 200 Indian cities,
              was struggling with understanding the profit drivers for its numerous branches. With branches dotted
              across diverse
              cities, understanding which ones were hitting the mark and which ones were lagging was crucial.
              <br> <br>
              <strong><b>Task:</b></strong>
              The task was to utilize Machine Learning to identify key contribution drivers for each
              branch,
              evaluate their performance, and craft a tailored strategy. This strategy would be based on each
              branch's
              growth, performance, and capital metrics.
              <br> <br>
              <strong><b>Action:</b></strong>
              Developed a robust Machine Learning module that analyzed branch data, extracting
              insights on profit drivers and performance metrics. The module segmented branches into distinct buckets
              based on
              their growth trajectory, operational performance, and capital allocation. Using these
              categorizations,
              individualized strategies were devised for each branch, ensuring that the approach was both
              data-driven
              and customized to each branch's unique challenges and opportunities.
              <br> <br>
              <strong><b>Result:</b></strong>
              The ML-infused strategy provided a roadmap to enhanced
              operational
              efficiency. The insights were so impactful that the case was presented directly to the board of
              trustees. The recommendations didn't just end as a presentation slide; they were incorporated into
              the
              next year's strategy planning, cementing the role of Machine Learning in driving strategic
              decisions for
              the non-profit.

              Mapping the 5G Future: GeoClustering Approach to Investment Priorities for Vodafone UK
            </h3>
            <p>
              <br>

              <strong><i>Industry: Telecommunication<br>
                  Use Case: Location prioritization, AI Based Business Strategy </i></strong>
              <br><br>
            <p><strong><b>Situation:</b></strong>
              Vodafone UK was poised to invest in the promising arena of 5G technology. However, with multiple
              locations vying for investment, the challenge was to determine which locations would be the most
              strategic and offer the best return on investment.
              <br><br>
              <strong><b>Task:</b></strong>
              The task was to design a robust ranking methodology that could prioritize these locations
              effectively
              for 5G investments. This methodology would ensure that Vodafone UK's investments were
              strategically
              placed to maximize impact and profitability.
              <br><br>
              <strong><b>Action:</b></strong>
              Multiple GeoClustering algorithms were stacked together to divide geographies into relatable and
              cohesive areas. The geographies were divided based on their physical proximity, competitors
              investment strategies, point of interests (business park, public place etc.), internet and bandwidth
              consumption and demographic features. These clusters were then ranked and prioritized based on Vodafone
              UK's strategic
              objectives, ensuring that the areas selected for investment were in line with the company's broader 5G
              vision.
              <br><br>
              <strong><b>Result:</b></strong>
              The GeoClustering ML approach provided Vodafone UK with a clear and actionable roadmap for their
              5G
              investments. Locations were not just chosen based on their inherent potential, but on a
              comprehensive
              strategy that took into account various factors to ensure optimal investment placement. This
              strategic
              initiative streamlined Vodafone UK's investment process, ensuring they were positioned to lead in
              the 5G
              revolution.
